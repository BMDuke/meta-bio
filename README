Connecting docker to on host machine to docker in jenkins requires bind mounting the docker runtime to that on the jenkins container.
For this to work you may need to grant permissions for this on the host machine by runinning 
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

And for grafana
sudo chown -R 472:472 logging/grafana/gf_conf/
sudo chown -R 472:472 logging/grafana/gf_data/

Known Issues
> Grafana data base access: Log into postgres and grant user embl_grafana access
> Grafana log in: chown 472:472 gf_data dir
> Jenkins 503: Restart container
> api_v2 503: Ensure rabbitmq server is up and running, then restart container
