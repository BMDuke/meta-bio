Connecting docker to on host machine to docker in jenkins requires bind mounting the docker runtime to that on the jenkins container.
For this to work you may need to grant permissions for this on the host machine by runinning 
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

And for grafana
sudo chown -R 472:472 logging/grafana/gf_conf/
sudo chown -R 472:472 logging/grafana/gf_data/
